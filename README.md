# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Tutorial

Welcome to the **DSA Tutorial Repository**! This repository is designed to help you master **Data Structures and Algorithms** — the foundation of computer science — through structured lessons, examples, and problem-solving practice.

---

## 📖 What is DSA?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** refer to techniques for organizing and storing data, and procedures (algorithms) for solving problems efficiently. Whether it's optimizing search engines, routing GPS paths, or managing databases — DSA is essential.
